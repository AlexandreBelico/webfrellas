For the new API project

I want to create an interface with AthenaNet, a provider of Electronic Health Record ,EHR, so that physicians using this EHR can safely share information/medical records with a Principal Investigator conducting a clinical trial. Exchange of data will be in real time. By building an interface between Clinicalmatch and AthenaNet , clinical trials registered on our website can be viewed by a physician seeking a clinical trial for a patient, automatically prescreen a patient using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and safely transfer medical records to the principal investigator.

There is already a sandbox for a developer to work on this interface, there is also documentation
